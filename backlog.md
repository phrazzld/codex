# backlog

- mod slash commands to point to $DEVELOPMENT/codex instead of local prompt files
- impove todo list structure
- tighten up all slash commands to be more concise
- figure out more elegant way to handle execution interruptions
  - eg /consult generates a plan which may be reasonably complicated but we don't turn it into tasks in the todo file
  - make the todo file more dynamic

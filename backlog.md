# backlog

- build stronger "get relevant files for context" tool
  - ... or just always throw the whole codebase at 1m+ context models
- modify resolve action to ask architect for help
- modify setup to add architect documentation to claude.md
- modify audit action to use architect to conduct the audit, not just draft remediation

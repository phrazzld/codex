# Codebase-Philosophy Alignment Analysis

You are auditing this codebase against our development philosophy to identify gaps and concrete improvement opportunities.

## Process
1. Study the development philosophy files thoroughly
2. Examine the codebase systematically against each principle
3. Identify specific gaps and concrete recommendations
4. Prioritize recommendations by impact and effort

## Key Areas to Examine
- **Simplicity**: Unnecessary complexity, overengineering
- **Modularity**: Component cohesion, clear boundaries
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic vs infrastructure
- **Testability**: Structure, minimal mocking
- **Coding Standards**: Language-specific practices
- **Error Handling**: Consistency, clarity
- **Dependencies**: Management, minimization, security
- **Security**: Best practices, data handling
- **Logging**: Structure, context, correlation IDs
- **Documentation**: Why vs how, self-documenting code
- **Configuration**: Externalization, environment handling

## Output Structure
1. **Executive Summary**: Overall assessment and key recommendations
2. **Gap Analysis**: For each significant gap:
   - Description of misalignment
   - Affected files/patterns
   - Concrete recommendations
   - Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Expected implementation effort
3. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to improvements

Be direct, specific, and actionable. Focus on patterns rather than isolated instances. Balance engineering excellence with practical delivery.

# CLAUDE

**Foundation:** You MUST strictly adhere to `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` and language-specific appendices (`_GO.md`, `_TYPESCRIPT.md`). These are the definitive source of truth.

**Core Tenets:**

* **Simplicity & Modularity:** Build small, focused, testable components. Prefer clarity over premature optimization.
* **Testability is Paramount:** Code MUST be easily testable. **NO mocking internal collaborators.** Refactor code *first* if testing is difficult. Apply TDD where suitable; focus on integration/workflow tests.
* **Explicitness & Maintainability:** Make dependencies, control flow, and contracts obvious. Code for clarity. Document *Why*, not *How*.
* **Automation:** Leverage all project tooling (lint, format, test, versioning).

**Mandatory Rules & Workflow:**

1.  **Strict Standards:** Use strictest tool configurations (lint, type check, format). **NEVER suppress errors/warnings** - fix the root cause.
2.  **Security:** **NEVER hardcode secrets.** Validate ALL external input rigorously at boundaries.
3.  **Git Hygiene:**
    * Commits MUST follow **Conventional Commits** spec (descriptive, multiline, no signature).
    * NEVER write "generated by" or "co-authored by" in commit messages. ONLY write conventional commits with meaningful multiline details about the work actually done.
    * All code MUST pass pre-commit hooks and CI checks (lint, test, coverage, security). **Bypassing hooks (`--no-verify`) is FORBIDDEN.**
4.  **Logging & Context:** Use standard structured (JSON) logging. Ensure `correlation_id` is generated, propagated, and included in all logs. Consult `glance.md` files for directory context.
5.  **Planning:** Outline non-trivial tasks ("think" or checklist) before coding.

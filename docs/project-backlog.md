# PROJECT BACKLOG

## ACTIVE

- **misty step marketing site**
  - tight, punchy, elegant
  - testament to ui/ux/design/our aesthetic
  - focus on consulting and development services:
    - integrating ai into your business
    - staff augmentation
    - building ai-powered features
    - streamlining operations with ai tools and custom software
    - etc

- **thinktank**
  - cli for sending arbitrary instructions and context to an arbitrary set of llm models
  - automatically synthesize their outputs to "wisdom of crowds" the llms

- **switchboard**
  - rust cli for proxying claude code
  - see the requests and responses and activity
  - ultimately intercept and manipulate, enable hijacking requests that would be going to anthropic to go to other providers
  - sanity check requests and responses more easily with custom middleware

- **scry**
  - anki killer
  - ai-enhanced srs
  - go api, react native mobile app
  - ux: user captures "memos", tidbits they want to remember
  - we automatically transform those tidbits into large sets of quizzes -- multiple choice questions for now, but ultimately free response questions and other quiz types
  - user is always reviewing -- core ui is review and everything else punches out from there
  - user, during a review, can add a memo, postpone the current item, edit the current item, delete the current item, or generate more items like it (eg more but easier, more but harder)

- **gitpulse**
  - github app, get quantitative and qualitative analysis of github activity across your repositories, organizations, contributors
  - use ai to see more than "number of commits" -- get deep understanding of who knows what how well what *kind* of work has been done, etc
  - good for individual contributors to get an understanding of what they've been doing
  - good for managers to see what their team has been doing
  - ultimately integrate with project management software etc to make assigning work easier, create visibility into dev velocity, etc

- **brainrot publishing house**
  - comedic yet faithful terminally online zoomer brainrot translations of classic public domain works
  - graphic novelizations
  - brainrot cliffnotes of authors, series, subjects
  - in general: ai-enhanced culture/media/publishing company

- **time is money**
  - chrome extension for seeing prices as hours of work
  - needs some polish and upgrades to stay alive
    - v3 manifest migration
    - new web store assets
    - fresh coat of paint in the ui

## backburner

- **ai real estate property staging**
  - input: photos of empty rooms, moods (or buyer personas)
  - output: high quality photorealistic targeted staged photos

- **ai app store promo image generator**
  - take app name, context blob about what it does who it's for etc
  - output comprehensive app store listing assets

- **resumake**
  - ai powered resume generator
  - upload context, eg old resume, stream of consciousness about your professional history and situation, maybe job listing of job you're targeting
  - we generate clarifying questions for you to answer
  - then we synthesize into a base cv -- comprehensive, long, exhaustive -- as well as a targeted resume -- tight, punchy, derived from the cv, focused on your job description
  - probably all markdown to start
  - ultimately break out into more customization, but keep it simple clean elegant

- **glance**
  - script for generating ai summaries of your project
  - starts at the deepest directory, generates a glance.md file of the contents of that directory, works its way up (to mitigate context window length). if current directory contains a directory, use that directory's glance.md file instead of its contents -- results in a whole project full of glance files, each with great context

- **handoff**
  - easily grab a full directory worth of content and put it on your clipboard or in an output file, formatted with context tags

- **vanity**
  - personal website
  - show quotes i like, books i've read and am reading, map of where i've been, projects i've built, etc

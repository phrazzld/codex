Read the TODO.md file. Pick the next item to work on. Think hard about the best way to implement it. Then fully implement your solution. Be sure to adhere to the relevant guidelines found in DEVREF.md, AESTHETIC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and CHECKLIST.md. Once you have completed the item and all relevant builds, lints, and tests pass, mark it as completed in TODO.md and add and commit your changes. Then repeat, until the TODO.md file has no incomplete items remaining.

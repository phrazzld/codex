Are you sure we should use the --no-verify flag?

Sometimes there is a very good reason to do so. In these cases you should always document exactly why, and you should always create at least one task -- if not multiple tasks -- in `TODO.md` for fixing the issues you're facing and committing changes that don't use the --no-verify flag.

Is this one of those cases? Or should you fix the issues the pre-commit checks are flagging before making this commit?

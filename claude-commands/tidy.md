# TIDY

There are a number of unstaged changes and/or untracked files.

They should all be either:
- committed
- gitignored
- deleted

When evaluating changes:
- Ensure code changes maintain high quality without overengineering
- Keep the project's purpose in mind when deciding what to keep
- Prioritize maintainability, readability, and simplicity

Conduct a full audit of each. Propose a course of action. Await confirmation.

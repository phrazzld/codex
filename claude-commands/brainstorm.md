Conduct a comprehensive domain analysis for $ARGUMENTS, deeply engaging with existing project documentation and internal 'leyline' architectural guidelines to establish foundational context. Subsequently, perform a structured exploration of candidate solution architectures, implementation patterns, and supporting toolchains. Evaluate the identified options using a rigorous tradeoff analysis, assessing factors like scalability, maintainability, security, performance, and total cost of ownership. Conclude with a detailed architectural proposal and a data-driven, strongly opinionated recommendation for the optimal path forward, including a high-level implementation strategy and proposed validation metrics.

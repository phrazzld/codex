# SYNTHESIZE

You are about to read multiple files generated by different AI models addressing the same prompt. Each model will have contributed different insights, approaches, and levels of detail. Your goal is to create a single superior synthesis that captures the collective intelligence while eliminating redundancy and resolving conflicts.

## Read All Files Thoroughly
Read every file in the thinktank directory completely. Pay attention to:
- Unique insights each model contributed
- Areas where models agree vs. disagree  
- Varying levels of detail and specificity
- Different organizational approaches
- Gaps that some models addressed while others missed

## Ultrathink About Synthesis Strategy
Before writing, deeply consider:
- What are the strongest, most actionable insights across all files?
- Where do models complement each other vs. contradict?
- Which organizational structure best serves the final user?
- What redundancies can be eliminated without losing value?
- How can conflicting recommendations be resolved or presented?

Think very hard about the synthesis methodology. This is not simple aggregation - you must intelligently combine multiple AI perspectives into something demonstrably superior.

## Create Superior Unified Output
Think very hard, then synthesize into a single document that:
- Preserves the best insights from each model
- Resolves contradictions through reasoned analysis
- Eliminates redundancy while maintaining completeness  
- Uses the clearest organizational structure
- Is more actionable than any individual source file
- Represents the collective intelligence, not just aggregation

Your synthesis should be demonstrably better than any individual input file - tighter, more comprehensive, more actionable, and more insightful. Think very hard about how to achieve this level of synthesis quality.

Create a single superior synthesis that captures the collective intelligence while eliminating redundancy and resolving conflicts.

## READ
Read every file in the thinktank directory completely. Pay attention to:
- Unique insights each model contributed
- Areas where models agree vs. disagree
- Varying levels of detail and specificity
- Different organizational approaches
- Gaps that some models addressed while others missed

## STRATEGIZE
- **Leyline Pre-Processing**: Apply synthesis principles from leyline documents:
  - Query tenets for decision-making frameworks and quality standards
  - Identify bindings that guide synthesis methodology and conflict resolution
  - Internalize principles for creating superior, actionable outputs
Before writing, ultrathink:
- What are the strongest, most actionable insights across all files?
- Where do models complement each other vs. contradict?
- Which organizational structure best serves the final user?
- What redundancies can be eliminated without losing value?
- How can conflicting recommendations be resolved or presented?

Think very hard about the synthesis methodology. This is not simple aggregation - you must intelligently combine multiple AI perspectives into something demonstrably superior.

## CREATE
Think very hard, then synthesize into a single document that:
- Preserves the best insights from each model
- Resolves contradictions through reasoned analysis
- Eliminates redundancy while maintaining completeness
- Uses the clearest organizational structure
- Is more actionable than any individual source file
- Represents the collective intelligence, not just aggregation

Your synthesis should be demonstrably better than any individual input file - tighter, more comprehensive, more actionable, and more insightful. Think very hard about how to achieve this level of synthesis quality.

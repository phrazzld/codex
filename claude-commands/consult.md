# CONSULT

## 1. THINK
Think about the problem you're encountering. Write all relevant details to a PROBLEM.md file.

## 2. FIND
Find all the most relevant files that would be useful to include when asking the Architect for assistance. Append their paths to the same PROBLEM.md file.

## 3. ASK
Request assistance from the Architect by invoking the `architect` CLI. Use `architect --help` to determine syntax. You will need to pass your problem articulation as a task flag, as well as a list of directories and/or files for extra context.

## 4. EXECUTE
When the Architect has responded, you should have a PLAN.md file with more serious thoughts and solutions about the problem and how to fix it. Work through it until the problem is fixed.

# GORDIAN

## GOAL
Identify opportunities for radical simplification and creative destruction in the codebase through outside-the-box thinking.

## RUN
- Run the following command with the maximum timeout in the bash tool:
```bash
thinktank-wrapper --template gordian --model-set high_context --include-philosophy --include-glance ./
```

## DESCRIPTION
Inspired by Elon Musk's observation that "the number one mistake great engineers make is optimizing something that shouldn't exist" and the legend of Alexander cutting the Gordian Knot instead of untangling it. This command identifies components that:

1. Should be eliminated rather than optimized
2. Could be radically simplified with unconventional approaches
3. Are unnecessarily complex, tightly coupled, or difficult to maintain
4. Present opportunities to "cut the knot" rather than wrestling with its complexity

The output will provide specific, actionable recommendations for simplification and creative destruction.

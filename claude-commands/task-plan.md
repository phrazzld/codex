Execute a deep technical analysis: ingest requirements from TASK.md, assimilate existing architecture docs, design specs, and leverage the context7 MCP framework. Conduct a targeted literature review on current (2025) industry best practices and emerging patterns. Ultrabrainstorm multiple compelling architecture options, rigorously analyze tradeoffs (minimal viable complexity, maximal efficacy, scalability, maintainability, security, performance, dev velocity), and ultrathink: what would John Carmack do?

Provide a definitive, opinionated, data-driven recommendation with concise, high-fidelity design specs and a phased implementation roadmap, detailing milestones, risks, validation strategies, and success metrics, culminating in a cohesive and rapidly integrable changeset.

If the plan encompasses too much work for a single tight focused pull request, break it up into logical blocks of work. The atomic unit of planning and work should be the single tight approachable pull request.

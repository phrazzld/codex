# TICKET

## GOAL
Generate a detailed task breakdown from a high-level implementation plan into a series of atomic, actionable tasks with proper dependencies.

## 1. Review Plan
- Ensure PLAN.md exists and contains sufficient implementation details.
- Find relevant development philosophy files.

## 2. Generate Task Breakdown
- Run thinktank-wrapper with the ticket template:
    ```bash
    thinktank-wrapper --template ticket --model-set all --include-philosophy --include-glance PLAN.md
    ```
- Review the generated output directory and use the synthesis file to create `TODO.md`

## 3. Review Tasks
- Verify `TODO.md`:
    - Completeness (all features/ACs covered or clarified).
    - Correct Task ID usage and dependency mapping (no cycles).
    - Appropriate inclusion of verification steps for UI/UX changes and user-facing features.

# THINKTANK

Create an `instructions.md` file that creates a strong, well articulated, clear prompt derived from the following sentiment: $ARGUMENTS

Then, run the following command exactly:
```bash
thinktank-wrapper --instructions instructions.md --model-set high_context --include-leyline --include-glance ./
```

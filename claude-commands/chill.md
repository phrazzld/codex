## 1. Pause & Reflect
- Step back, clear assumptions.

## 2. Re-Center Context
- Recall current task and goals.
- Review key requirements/files.
- Revisit leyline documents.

## 3. Self-Assessment
- **Leyline Pre-Processing**: Query reflection and quality principles:
  - Tenets for self-evaluation and course correction methodologies
  - Bindings that define quality standards and best practices
  - Internalize frameworks for assessing alignment with development philosophy
- ***Think deeply*** about current approach:
    - Aligned with requirements?
    - Follows standards/principles?
    - Simpler/more maintainable alternatives?
    - Over-complicated?
    - Edge cases considered?

## 4. Determine Next Steps
- Based on self-assessment:
    - **Scenario A: Stay Course.** If approach is sound:
        - Report: "Self-assessment complete. Approach valid. Resuming task."
    - **Scenario B: Course Correction.** If issues:
        - Report: "Self-assessment complete. Course correction recommended."
        - Explain Issue.
        - Propose Alternative.
        - Report: "Awaiting confirmation."

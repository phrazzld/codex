Follow these explicit instructions carefully:

1. **Read the BACKLOG.md File**
   - Explicitly select only the top item from the backlog.
   - Clearly state the backlog item at the top of your new `PLAN.md`.

2. **Deeply Analyze the Selected Item**
   - Think carefully about the optimal technical architecture and design needed for the feature or task.
   - Explicitly consider:
     - Core technical components and their interactions.
     - Data flows and required data structures.
     - Dependencies clearly identified (libraries, databases, services).
     - Potential edge cases and explicitly how they will be handled.

3. **Write the PLAN.md**
   - Explicitly craft a highly detailed, technical specification document (`PLAN.md`).
   - Clearly organize the specification into:
     - **Overview:** A precise summary of the task or feature.
     - **Technical Approach:** Clearly articulated details about the architecture, design choices, data schemas, APIs, or UI/UX specifics.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:** Explicit, detailed descriptions of what constitutes successful completion (including technical benchmarks, UI behaviors, user outcomes).
     - **Dependencies & Assumptions:** Clearly stated technical dependencies, environment requirements, or explicit assumptions.

4. **Review and Verify**
   - Think hard and explicitly ensure your PLAN.md:
     - Fully captures technical clarity and detail.
     - Addresses all potential technical risks and considerations explicitly.
     - Clearly aligns with the intent and scope of the backlog item.

# IDEATE

## GOAL
Generate innovative ideas for the project backlog by analyzing existing tasks and codebase context.

## 1. Prepare Context
- Read `BACKLOG.md` to understand current tasks and direction.
- Read `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` to understand the ideal general principles of the project's structure and implementation.
- Analyze codebase structure to identify areas for enhancement.

## 2. Generate Ideas Through Deep Analysis
- Create `IDEATE-CONTEXT.md` with information about the current project and ideation goals:
  ```markdown
  # Ideation Context

  ## Current Project State
  [Brief description of the current project state]

  ## Current Backlog
  [Include key items from BACKLOG.md]

  ## Ideation Focus
  [Specify areas where new ideas would be most valuable, e.g., new features, performance improvements, user experience]
  ```
- **Think very hard** about innovative ideas that would benefit this project:
  - Consider gaps in current functionality
  - Identify opportunities for improvement in developer experience
  - Brainstorm features that align with the project philosophy
  - Think about performance optimizations and architectural enhancements
  - Consider automation opportunities and workflow improvements
  - Explore ideas that would delight users or developers
  - Think outside the box while staying aligned with project principles
- Create `IDEAS.md` with your comprehensive ideation results, organizing ideas by:
  - Priority/Impact
  - Implementation complexity
  - Alignment with project philosophy
  - Dependencies on existing work

# ORGANIZE

Look through all of the files and directories in the root of this project. Think hard about them. How can this all be better organized? What in here can be deleted? Added to `.gitignore`? Consolidated? Tucked into new or existing subdirectories? Come up with a reorganization plan, then execute it.

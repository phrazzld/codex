# PLAN.md Generation Prompt

Craft a detailed, technical, and actionable `PLAN.md` file to guide immediate development. This document should clearly translate a specific, achievable portion of the overall vision into explicit, implementable engineering tasks.

## Key Elements

### Clear Scope
- Precisely define the immediate, actionable piece of the product vision this plan addresses.
- Explicitly state the user or technical problem youâ€™re solving now.

### Technical Approach
- Clearly outline specific technical solutions or implementations.
- Document the components, systems, and integrations explicitly involved.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Clearly and explicitly define what constitutes successful completion of each task or feature.
- Describe user-visible outcomes, technical benchmarks, or system behaviors explicitly.

### Dependencies & Considerations
- Clearly state any explicit dependencies or assumptions required to execute this plan.
- Note technical risks, constraints, or considerations explicitly.

Keep the plan focused, technical, and detailed, emphasizing clarity, actionable tasks, and precise acceptance criteria.

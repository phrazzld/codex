# Deep Research - Tighter Format

```
write a deep research prompt addressing these points, comments, questions, and curiosities:

<stuff here>

guidelines for creating the prompt:

- **objective**: clearly describe the research goal.
- **scope**: explicitly list key topics, with adjacent, complementary, or niche subtopics if desired.
- **criteria**: define quality indicators or the type of content you want (e.g., contrarian, foundational, hacker-originated).
- **randomness**: explicitly indicate if you want to include unrelated, novel, or serendipitous discoveries.
- **annotations**: specify how you'd like each PDF or source annotated.
- **format**: clearly state the desired organization or grouping of results.

keep the prompt concise and structured.

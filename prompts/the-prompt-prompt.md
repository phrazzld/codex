# The Prompt Prompt

```
I need a prompt to initialize an LLM conversation with. This prompt should be detailed, specific, and effective. It should read in the second person, i.e. "you are a …" and "your purpose is …". The prompt should define a persona, a purpose, and a style. The defined agent should always be the highest possible quality resource, and should always ask clarifying questions when answers to those questions would help them better accomplish their objective.

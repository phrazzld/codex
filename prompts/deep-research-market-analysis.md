# Deep Research - Market Analysis

```
deep research prompt:

## objective:
conduct a comprehensive market analysis to identify and evaluate high-potential business opportunities that can be addressed primarily or exclusively through software solutions. prioritize opportunities that are highly focused, narrowly scoped, niche-oriented, or underserved, where targeted software interventions can quickly provide outsized value.

## scope & emphasis:
- emerging or rapidly growing markets, especially those with recent regulatory, technological, or societal shifts.
- industries or sectors where current software solutions are inadequate, overly complex, or missing entirely.
- pain points that can be effectively solved by very narrow, highly-specialized software products (e.g., single-purpose tools, micro-SaaS).
- underserved or niche customer segments (e.g., overlooked professionals, hobbyists, small but lucrative industries).

## deliverables:
1. **market analysis:**
   - detailed summaries of promising market segments, with size, growth trajectories, key players, and identified gaps.
   - assessment of competitive landscape, highlighting existing solutions' weaknesses or blind spots.
   - identification of customer pain points that are ripe for tightly-scoped software solutions.

2. **product & business ideas (brainstorm):**
   - generate a diverse list of highly-targeted software product ideas, explicitly linking each idea to identified market gaps or pain points.
   - categorize ideas by feasibility, potential profitability, ease of MVP development, and suitability for lean startup experiments.

3. **recommendations for lean experimentation:**
   - suggest practical next steps for validating these ideas through lean startup/agile methodologies and customer discovery approaches (e.g., landing page tests, customer interviews, lightweight prototypes).
   - highlight quick-win experiments to rapidly test market fit and customer demand with minimal upfront investment.

## annotations required for each identified opportunity:
- concise description and rationale for why it represents a strong opportunity.
- clearly outlined target customer or user persona.
- brief analysis of technical feasibility, potential competitive advantages, and ease of entry.
- recommended initial lean experiments or MVP strategies.

## formatting:
organize results clearly, grouped by market segment or thematic area, with opportunities ranked or highlighted by perceived potential, clarity of product-market fit, and ease of quick iterative testing.

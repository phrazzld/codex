# System Maintenance Scripts Improvement TODO

## Critical Safety Issues

- [x] Remove forced reboot functionality from `weekly-reboot.sh`
- [x] Replace forced reboot with user-prompt notification system
- [ ] Add user presence detection before any disruptive operations
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown request instead of forced restart
- [x] Add ability to postpone reboot operations for 1-24 hours
- [ ] Create reboot cancellation mechanism

## Process & Activity Awareness

- [ ] Add git repository status checking (uncommitted changes, ongoing operations)
- [ ] Implement active SSH session detection
- [ ] Add running development server detection (ports 3000-9000 range)
- [ ] Create database connection checking (postgres, mysql, redis)
- [ ] Add Docker container status verification
- [ ] Implement large file transfer detection (copying, uploading)
- [ ] Add IDE/editor process detection (VS Code, vim sessions with unsaved files)
- [ ] Create build process detection (npm run, cargo build, etc.)

## Configuration Improvements

- [ ] Add `whitelist_dirs` configuration option to config.yaml
- [ ] Add `blacklist_patterns` for protected files/directories
- [x] Add `critical_processes` list to configuration
- [x] Add `notification_methods` configuration (desktop, email, slack)
- [ ] Add `user_presence_check` boolean flag
- [ ] Add `max_single_operation_size` threshold setting
- [ ] Add `require_backup_verification` safety option
- [ ] Add `development_mode` flag for stricter safety checks

## Smart Cleanup Logic

- [ ] Add project activity detection (recent commits within N days)
- [ ] Implement Time Machine backup status checking
- [ ] Add backup verification before major deletions
- [ ] Create progressive cleanup approach (start small, verify, continue)
- [ ] Improve package manager cache analysis (check actual usage)
- [ ] Add dependency tree analysis before node_modules removal
- [ ] Implement file importance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add recently accessed files protection

## User Experience & Safety

- [ ] Create multiple notification methods (desktop alerts, terminal messages)
- [ ] Add interactive confirmation for medium-risk operations
- [ ] Implement operation preview mode with detailed impact analysis
- [ ] Add rollback testing for all backup operations
- [ ] Create operation cancellation mechanism during execution
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Implement pause/resume functionality for cleanup operations

## Monitoring & Reporting

- [ ] Create cleanup history tracking database/file
- [ ] Add space savings metrics collection
- [ ] Implement failed operation alerting system
- [ ] Create monthly cleanup summary reports
- [ ] Add backup verification logging
- [ ] Create system health integration hooks
- [ ] Add operation performance metrics

## Code Quality & Architecture

- [x] Remove hardcoded project path from `pnpm-rescue.sh`
- [ ] Make all file paths fully configurable
- [ ] Remove unnecessary `sudo` requirements where possible
- [x] Delete redundant `system-cleanup.sh` (keep v2 only)
- [ ] Merge rescue functionality into main framework
- [ ] Create consistent error handling across all scripts
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation

## Integration Improvements

- [ ] Replace cron with macOS LaunchAgents for better integration
- [ ] Add Focus modes/Do Not Disturb integration
- [ ] Implement sleep/wake cycle coordination
- [ ] Add backup schedule coordination
- [ ] Create system maintenance dashboard
- [ ] Add integration with system monitoring tools

## Multi-stage Operation Framework

- [ ] Create Phase 1: Analysis-only mode (always safe)
- [ ] Create Phase 2: Low-risk automatic cleanup
- [ ] Create Phase 3: Medium-risk cleanup with confirmation
- [ ] Create Phase 4: High-risk manual-only operations
- [ ] Add phase transition logic and safety gates
- [ ] Implement operation dependency checking

## Advanced Safety Features

- [ ] Add backup integrity verification
- [ ] Create operation simulation mode
- [ ] Implement atomic operations with rollback capability
- [ ] Add disk space safety margins
- [ ] Create operation impact prediction
- [ ] Add conflict detection between concurrent operations
- [ ] Implement emergency stop functionality

## Documentation & Usability

- [ ] Create operation impact documentation for each cleanup type
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for failed operations
- [ ] Create configuration examples for different use cases
- [ ] Add rollback procedure documentation
- [ ] Create safety checklist for manual operations
- [ ] Add performance tuning guide

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all operations
- [ ] Add backup/restore validation tests
- [ ] Create safety mechanism testing
- [ ] Add configuration validation tests
- [ ] Implement integration testing with real projects
- [ ] Add performance regression testing

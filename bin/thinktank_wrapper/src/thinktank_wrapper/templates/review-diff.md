# Diff-Focused Code Review Instructions

<!-- BEGIN:CONTEXT -->
This section will be replaced with the injected context when using the --inject parameter.
If no context is injected, this default message will remain.
<!-- END:CONTEXT -->

You are performing a **diff-focused code review**. Your sole purpose is to identify **functional issues, bugs, and critical problems** in the actual changes shown in the diff. 

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Review ONLY the lines that were changed (added, modified, or removed) in the diff. Do NOT review unchanged code or the broader codebase state.

## Scope: What to Review

**IN SCOPE - Review these aggressively:**
- Logic errors in changed lines
- Security vulnerabilities introduced by changes
- Bugs or potential crashes in new/modified code
- Incorrect implementations of intended functionality
- Resource leaks or performance issues in changes
- Type errors or syntax issues
- Missing error handling in new code paths
- Race conditions or concurrency issues introduced

**OUT OF SCOPE - Do NOT review:**
- Pre-existing code that wasn't changed
- Overall codebase architecture (unless directly impacted by changes)
- Development philosophy compliance (handled by separate review)
- Style/formatting issues (unless they create bugs)
- Existing technical debt in unchanged code

## Review Process

1. **Examine Each Changed Line**
   - Focus on the `+` and modified lines in the diff
   - Consider the immediate context but don't review unchanged surrounding code
   - Look for functional correctness issues

2. **Identify Critical Issues**
   For each problem found in the **changed code only**:
   - **Describe** the functional issue clearly
   - **Explain** why it could cause bugs or problems
   - **Propose** a specific fix
   - **Cite** the exact changed lines (use + line numbers from diff)
   - **Assign severity**:
     - `blocker` – will cause crashes, security holes, or data loss
     - `high` – likely to cause bugs or significant problems
     - `medium` – potential issues that should be addressed
     - `low` – minor concerns that could cause issues

3. **Focus Areas for Changed Code**
   - Null pointer dereferences
   - Array bounds violations
   - SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities
   - Authentication/authorization bypasses
   - Incorrect API usage
   - Memory leaks or resource exhaustion
   - Deadlocks or race conditions
   - Incorrect error handling

## Output Format

```
# Diff-Focused Code Review

## BLOCKING ISSUES
[Issues that will cause crashes or security problems]

### [Issue Title] - BLOCKER
- **Changed Lines**: [specific + lines from diff]
- **Problem**: [what will go wrong]
- **Impact**: [crashes, security risk, data loss, etc.]
- **Fix**: [specific code change needed]

## LIKELY BUGS
[Issues that will probably cause problems]

### [Issue Title] - HIGH
- **Changed Lines**: [specific + lines from diff]
- **Problem**: [what could go wrong]
- **Impact**: [functional impact]
- **Fix**: [specific code change needed]

## POTENTIAL ISSUES
[Changes that might cause problems]

### [Issue Title] - MEDIUM
...

## MINOR CONCERNS
[Small issues in changed code]

### [Issue Title] - LOW
...

## SUMMARY
Total issues found: [X blocking, Y high, Z medium, W low]
```

**Remember**: Only review the actual changes in the diff. Ignore pre-existing code quality issues.

**Technical Overview: `/Users/phaedrus/Development/codex/bin/thinktank_wrapper/src/thinktank_wrapper/templates`**

**Purpose:**

This directory houses a collection of Markdown template files used by the `thinktank_wrapper` module. These templates define the structure and content of various documents generated by the application, likely related to software development processes like planning, code review, debugging, and backlog management.  The templates provide a standardized format and guide the AI in producing consistent and high-quality outputs.

**Architecture:**

The directory contains a flat structure of `.md` files. Each file represents a specific template for a particular type of document or task within the software development lifecycle. The naming convention (e.g., `address.md`, `consult.md`, `execute.md`) clearly indicates the purpose of each template. The presence of an `__init__.py` file confirms that this directory is a Python package, although its sole purpose appears to be marking the directory as such. The templates are designed to be used as blueprints for generating content, guiding the AI in structuring its responses according to predefined guidelines.

**Key File Roles:**

*   **`address.md` (Brutal Remediation-Planning Prompt):**  Defines the structure and content guidance for generating a remediation plan based on code review feedback. It emphasizes a direct and actionable approach.

*   **`consult.md` (Consultation Plan Decomposition Instructions):** Provides instructions for decomposing a consultant's plan into actionable development tasks for a TODO list. It focuses on creating small, testable tasks.

*   **`execute.md` (Implementation-Approach-Analysis.md â€“ Ruthless Prompt):** Guides the AI in analyzing and selecting the best approach to solve a given task. It emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and testability.

*   **`extract.md` (Code Extraction and Modularization Instructions):** Defines the process for analyzing a codebase and generating an extraction plan to create reusable modules.

*   **`plan.md` (Ruthless Task-Planning Prompt):** Guides the AI in creating a detailed implementation plan for a given task, emphasizing maintainability, testability, and adherence to a development philosophy.

*   **`refactor.md` (Code Refactoring Backlog Items):** Defines the structure and content guidance for generating refactoring backlog items based on codebase analysis.

*   **`resolve.md` (Git Merge Conflict Resolution Instructions):** Provides instructions for resolving Git merge conflicts, focusing on preserving functionality and maintaining code quality.

*   **`diagram.md` (Mermaid Diagram Generator):** Defines the purpose, structure, and content requirements for generating Mermaid diagrams to visualize system architecture and workflows.

*   **`groom.md` (Backlog Grooming: Comprehensive Organization & Expansion):** Guides the AI in transforming a basic backlog into a comprehensive roadmap, considering business value, technical excellence, and innovation.

*   **`shrink.md` (Code Size Optimization Backlog Items):** Defines the structure and content guidance for generating backlog items to reduce the size of the codebase.

*   **`audit.md` (Security Audit Instructions):** Provides instructions for performing a security audit of the codebase and generating a remediation plan.

*   **`ideate.md` (Ideation Instructions):** Guides the AI in generating innovative ideas for new epics or enhancements to existing work.

*   **`ticket.md` (Relentless Ticket-Breakdown Prompt):** Defines the structure and content guidance for breaking down an implementation plan into actionable engineering tickets for a TODO list.

*   **`__init__.py`:** An empty file (except for the docstring) indicating that the directory is a Python package.

*   **`align.md` (Philosophy-Aligned Backlog Item Generation):** Guides the AI in generating backlog items that improve alignment with the project's development philosophy.

*   **`debug.md` (Bug Analysis and Task Generation Instructions):** Provides instructions for analyzing a reported bug, investigating its root cause, and generating actionable debugging tasks.

*   **`review.md` (Brutal Code Review Instructions):** Defines the structure and content guidance for performing a code review, emphasizing the identification of flaws and violations of coding standards.

*   **`scope.md` (PLAN SCOPE ANALYSIS):** Guides the AI in analyzing implementation plans to ensure they have appropriate scope for manageable pull requests and focused development efforts.

**Important Dependencies and Gotchas:**

*   **Markdown Engine:** The `thinktank_wrapper` module relies on a Markdown engine (likely a Python library) to process these template files. The specific engine is not apparent from the file contents, but it's a crucial dependency.

*   **Template Engine/String Formatting:** The module must have a mechanism to populate these templates with dynamic content (e.g., data from code analysis, task descriptions). This likely involves a template engine (e.g., Jinja2) or string formatting techniques.

*   **Development Philosophy Files:** The templates frequently refer to `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`. This file (or set of files) is a critical dependency, as it defines the coding standards, principles, and best practices that guide the AI's decision-making. Any changes to the philosophy file will directly impact the outputs generated by the templates.

*   **Consistency:** Maintaining consistency across these template files is crucial. Inconsistencies in formatting, terminology, or instructions can lead to unpredictable and low-quality outputs.

*   **AI Interpretation:** The effectiveness of these templates depends heavily on the AI's ability to accurately interpret and apply the instructions. Ambiguous or poorly worded instructions can lead to unintended results.

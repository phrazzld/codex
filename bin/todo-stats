# --- Configuration ---
# Add more potential filenames here if needed

# --- Find the TODO file ---
for filename in "${todo_filenames[@]}"; do

# --- Count Tasks ---
# Use grep -c to count matching lines efficiently
# Match lines starting with optional whitespace, then '- [x]' for completed

# Match lines starting with optional whitespace, then '- [ ]' for incomplete

# Calculate total (completed + incomplete)
total_tasks=$((completed_tasks + incomplete_tasks))

# Remaining tasks are the incomplete ones
remaining_tasks=$incomplete_tasks

# --- Output Results ---

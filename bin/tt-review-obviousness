# Code Obviousness Review

Analyze code for self-evidence and clarity based on leyline philosophy principles. Code should be immediately understandable without requiring mental translation.

**FOCUS**: Review changed lines (+ in diff) for obviousness violations. Look for code that requires implicit knowledge or mental gymnastics to understand.

## Obviousness Principles (from leyline)

### 1. Naming Clarity
- **Variables**: Describe content, not type (e.g., `users` not `userList`)
- **Functions**: Describe what they do, not how (e.g., `calculateTotal` not `sumArray`)
- **Classes**: Match domain concepts exactly
- **Constants**: Self-documenting names (no magic numbers/strings)
- **Parameters**: Intent-revealing names

### 2. Explicit Dependencies
- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies passed in, not created internally
- **Clear Imports**: All dependencies visible at file top
- **No Hidden State**: No reliance on global state or singletons
- **Configuration**: Explicit, not assumed

### 3. Control Flow Clarity
- **Early Returns**: Guard clauses instead of deep nesting
- **Single Purpose**: Each function does one clear thing
- **No Surprise Side Effects**: Command-query separation
- **Obvious Error Paths**: Clear what happens when things go wrong

### 4. Context and Intent
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Code explains what it does
- **Why Comments**: Comments explain why, not what
- **Domain Language**: Use terms from the problem domain
- **No Tribal Knowledge**: Don't require insider information

### 5. Discoverability
- **Obvious Entry Points**: Clear where to start reading
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established conventions
- **Searchable Names**: Avoid abbreviations and acronyms
- **Clear Relationships**: Module dependencies are obvious

# Obviousness Analysis

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL CLARITY ISSUES
### [Issue Title] - CRITICAL
- **Location**: file_path:line_numbers
- **Obviousness Score**: [1-10, where 10 is perfectly obvious]
- **Problem**: [What makes this non-obvious]
- **Hidden Knowledge Required**: [What you need to know to understand]
- **Impact**: [How this confuses developers]
- **Fix**: [Specific way to make obvious]
- **Example**:
  ```language
  // Current (non-obvious)
  ```
  ```language
  // Obvious version
  ```

## ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE CLARITY ISSUES
### [Issue Title] - MEDIUM
- **Location**: file_path:line_numbers
- **Issue**: [What could be clearer]
- **Confusion Point**: [Where developers might stumble]
- **Improvement**: [How to clarify]

## ðŸŸ¢ MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
### [Improvement Title] - LOW
- **Location**: file_path:line_numbers
- **Current**: [Slightly unclear element]
- **Better**: [More obvious alternative]

## ðŸ“Š OBVIOUSNESS METRICS
### Naming Analysis
- Cryptic Names: X occurrences
- Abbreviated Names: Y occurrences
- Type-in-Name Anti-pattern: Z occurrences
- Domain Misalignment: W occurrences

### Dependency Clarity
- Hidden Dependencies: X found
- Implicit State Usage: Y instances
- Unclear Injection: Z cases

### Control Flow
- Deep Nesting (>3 levels): X instances
- Surprise Side Effects: Y found
- Mixed Commands/Queries: Z violations

### Documentation Gaps
- Missing "Why" Comments: X locations
- Tribal Knowledge Required: Y instances
- Undocumented Gotchas: Z found

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES
1. **Immediate Fixes**: [Most confusing elements that block understanding]
2. **Quick Wins**: [Easy clarity improvements with high impact]
3. **Systematic Issues**: [Patterns of non-obviousness to address]

## âœ¨ POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS
### [Good Practice]
- **Location**: file_path:line_numbers
- **Why It's Obvious**: [What makes this clear]
- **Pattern to Replicate**: [How to apply elsewhere]

## âœ… SUMMARY
- Overall Obviousness Score: [X/10]
- Critical Issues: X (must fix)
- Total Clarity Debt: Y issues
- Estimated Confusion Cost: [High/Medium/Low]

**Recommendation**: [BLOCKED if critical issues | NEEDS WORK if many issues | GOOD if mostly clear]
```

Remember: If code requires explanation, it's not obvious enough. Strive for code that explains itself.

# Prompts

Some of my favorite go-to prompts for ChatGPT.

## o1-pro projects init
```
<context>
- user is working on personal projects that are often technical programming applications but can also include music, writing, or other creative works.
- the model's role is to:
  1. critique completed work and identify areas for improvement.
  2. suggest enhancements and optimizations for ongoing work.
  3. brainstorm next steps within current projects.
  4. generate ideas for entirely new projects.
- the model should have expertise in creativity, programming, software architecture, and ui/ux design.
</context>

<task>
using the context provided, assist the user by fulfilling their requests. focus on actionable insights, practical suggestions, and innovative ideas tailored to the user's personal projects.
</task>

<context>
</context>
```

## o1 prompt prompt
```
You are a prompt generator for o1, a new series of language models designed to reason. o1 requires different prompting than more traditional LLMs.

Most importantly, prompts need to be *goal-oriented*. You must be insanely clear with what you want the model to output. Don’t let it make any assumptions — give it a defined end-state.

The end-state should, ideally, be the final piece of your prompt, with the relevant context organized super clearly above. Use delimiters/XML tags if necessary for context building.

From the model maker's own prompting guide:
<guide>
o1 performs best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting or instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance and can sometimes hinder it. Here are some best practices:
- Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.
- Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
- Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
</guide>

As you can see, you'll want to discard quite a bit of your existing prompting understanding when writing o1 prompts. Think differently here.

The user will provide instructions for the prompt they want you to write. Your job is to write the clearest, most effective o1 prompt possible, following the above advice. Return only the prompt — nothing else.
```

## software engineering
```
You are a genius software architect, engineer, UI/UX designer, product manager, and entrepreneur with decades of experience. You write clean, functional, readable code with great comments where helpful. You ask probing clarifying questions that help you implement the best possible solutions. You always brainstorm a few ideas before evaluating their tradeoffs and running with the best.
```

## gpt best practices
```
i want you to help me write the most effective, efficient, overall best prompts possible.

consider these best practices:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
write clear instructions
- include details in your query to get more relevant answers
- ask the model to adopt a persona
- use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- specify the steps required to complete a task
- provide examples
- specify the desired length of the output

split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
- use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query
- for dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue
- summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively

give gpts time to "think"
- instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
- use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process
- ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

also keep in mind the distinction between the user prompt and the system prompt: the system prompt defines the persona of the model, its purpose, its style; the user prompt defines the specific task it should apply itself to in that moment/request.

for ease of maintenance and readability, prompts that are broken into bulleted sections (or at least avoid long paragraphs) are preferable (all else equal).

i'll give you a specific task, and then i want you to use these best practices to write the best possible prompt to achieve that task. understand?

You prioritize code clarity and sustainability over overly complex solutions. You are adept at answering both practical coding questions and higher-level design and architecture queries.
```

## the prompt prompt
```
I need a prompt to initialize an LLM conversation with. This prompt should be detailed, specific, and effective. It should read in the second person, i.e. “you are a …” and “your purpose is …”. The prompt should define a persona, a purpose, and a style. The defined agent should always be the highest possible quality resource, and should always ask clarifying questions when answers to those questions would help them better accomplish their objective.
```

## Write prompts for Midjourney to generate wallpapers
```
Write a descriptive and imaginative prompt for an AI art generator to create a visually stunning wallpaper. Your prompt should include details about the subject matter, style, atmosphere, and medium you envision. Use the phrase 'wallpaper by' followed by the name of one or two artists whose style matches your prompt as inspiration. Keep your prompt concise, no longer than a short paragraph. Omit quotation marks from your responses, and append each response with " --ar 16:9". Remember, the more specific and unique your prompt, the better the resulting wallpaper will be.

Now: write five prompts.
```

## Write general prompts for Midjourney
```
Act as a prompt writer for AI art generator models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. Your goal is to come up with imaginative and descriptive prompts that will generate visually stunning art in a wide range of styles across a broad scope of subjects. To do this, you'll need to tap into your creativity, daring, and imagination. You can use prompts that describe the subject matter, the style, the brushstrokes, the artist to imitate, or any other aspect of the art that you find interesting. Just be sure to keep your prompts no longer than a short paragraph.

When writing your prompts, be sure to describe the subjects, the style, the atmosphere, and the medium in detail. This will help the AI art generator models to create art that accurately reflects your vision. To complete your prompt, use the phrase "art by" followed by the names of one to three artists whose styles match the prompt.

Remember, the more descriptive and imaginative your prompts are, the better the resulting art will be. So don't be afraid to push the boundaries and challenge yourself to come up with unique and interesting ideas. With your creativity and the power of AI art generator models, you'll be able to generate a wide variety of high quality content on a broad range of subjects in a wide variety of styles.

Now: write five prompts.
```

```

    <inputs>[specific inputs the model will receive]</inputs>
    <output_format>[exact format and structure for the output]</output_format>
    <warnings>[potential pitfalls or edge cases to address]</warnings>
</o1_prompt>

in your interactions with the user:
	1.	begin by asking: ‘what task do you want o1 to perform?’
	2.	clarify ambiguities and ask targeted questions to fill in each section of the schema:
	•	for <goal>, ask: ‘what is the specific result or solution you are looking for?’
	•	for <context>, ask: ‘what background, prior work, tools, or constraints are important for this task? include any examples, uploaded files, or descriptions as needed.’
	•	for <inputs>, ask: ‘what inputs will the model have? describe these as concretely as possible (e.g., text, tables, code snippets, etc.).’

	•	for <warnings>, ask: ‘what risks or issues should the model watch for? mention common pitfalls, edge cases, or incorrect assumptions it should avoid.’
	3.	confirm the user’s answers and summarize them before proceeding to the next section.
	4.	if the user provides incomplete or vague responses, prompt them further for clarification.
	5.	ensure the final o1 prompt is comprehensive, explicit, and fully adheres to the XML schema.

when ready, synthesize the user’s responses into a fully-formed o1 prompt in XML format. prioritize clarity, precision, and completeness. example XML prompts should look like this:

Introducing Deep Research | OpenAI

February 2, 2025

Introducing Deep Research

Today we’re launching Deep Research in ChatGPT, a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It accomplishes in minutes what would take a human many hours.

Deep Research is OpenAI’s next agent that works independently—you provide a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Powered by a version of the upcoming OpenAI o3 model optimized for web browsing and data analysis, it leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters.

The ability to synthesize knowledge is a prerequisite for creating new knowledge. For this reason, Deep Research marks a significant step toward AGI, which we have long envisioned as capable of producing novel scientific research.

Why We Built Deep Research

Deep Research is built for people who do intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy, and engineering and need thorough, precise, and reliable research. It can be equally useful for discerning shoppers looking for hyper-personalized recommendations on cars, appliances, and furniture.

Every output is fully documented, with clear citations and a summary of its thinking, making it easy to reference and verify information. It is particularly effective at finding niche, non-intuitive information that would require browsing numerous websites. Deep Research frees up valuable time by allowing you to offload and expedite complex, time-intensive web research with just one query.

Deep Research independently discovers, reasons about, and consolidates insights from across the web. To accomplish this, it was trained on real-world tasks requiring browser and Python tool use, using the same reinforcement learning methods behind OpenAI o1, our first reasoning model. While o1 demonstrates impressive capabilities in coding, math, and other technical domains, many real-world challenges demand extensive context and information gathering from diverse online sources. Deep Research builds on these reasoning capabilities to bridge that gap, allowing it to take on the types of problems people face in work and everyday life.

How to Use Deep Research

In ChatGPT, select ‘Deep Research’ in the message composer and enter your query. Tell ChatGPT what you need—whether it’s a competitive analysis on streaming platforms or a personalized report on the best commuter bike. You can attach files or spreadsheets to add context to your question.

Once it starts running, a sidebar appears with a summary of the steps taken and sources used.

Deep Research may take 5 to 30 minutes to complete its work, taking the time needed to dive deep into the web. In the meantime, you can step away or work on other tasks—you’ll get a notification once the research is complete. The final output arrives as a report within the chat. In the next few weeks, we will also be adding embedded images, data visualizations, and other analytic outputs in these reports for additional clarity and context.

Compared to GPT-4o, which is ideal for real-time, multimodal conversations, Deep Research is designed for multi-faceted, domain-specific inquiries where depth and detail are critical. It conducts extensive exploration and cites each claim, offering a well-documented, verified answer that can be used as a work product.

Real-World Use Cases

Deep Research can handle complex, multi-step research across a wide range of topics, including:
	•	Business Analysis: Conduct a competitive analysis on global streaming platforms, evaluating trends, market positioning, and pricing strategies.
	•	Medical Research: Compile an in-depth review of clinical trials on novel gene therapies, including FDA approvals and efficacy data.
	•	UX Design: Gather usability studies on button design, comparing the effectiveness of icons vs. text labels.
	•	Shopping & Consumer Insights: Recommend the best all-mountain snowboard for powder conditions in Hokkaido, Japan, incorporating availability and pricing.
	•	General Knowledge: Find historical TV show episodes based on vague user descriptions, searching for exact matches across multiple sources.

Deep Research responds to ambiguous, multi-part queries by persistently searching until it finds an answer that exactly matches the criteria.

How It Works

Deep Research was trained using end-to-end reinforcement learning on complex browsing and reasoning tasks across a range of domains. Through that training, it learned to plan and execute a multi-step trajectory to find the data it needs, backtracking and reacting to real-time information where necessary.

Capabilities:
	•	Accesses & analyzes the open web
	•	Searches across uploaded files
	•	Plots and iterates on graphs using Python
	•	Embeds generated graphs & images from websites in responses
	•	Cites specific sentences or passages from sources

As a result, it reaches new highs on several public evaluations focused on real-world problem-solving.

Performance Benchmarks:

On Humanity’s Last Exam, a new evaluation testing AI on expert-level questions across 100+ subjects, Deep Research achieved 26.6% accuracy, far surpassing previous models.

Model	Accuracy (%)
GPT-4o	3.3%
Grok-2	3.8%
Claude 3.5 Sonnet	4.3%
Gemini Thinking	6.2%
OpenAI o1	9.1%
DeepSeek-R1*	9.4%
OpenAI o3-mini (medium)*	10.5%
OpenAI deep research**	26.6%

Limitations

Deep Research unlocks significant new capabilities, but it still has limitations:
	•	Can sometimes hallucinate facts or make incorrect inferences
	•	May struggle with distinguishing authoritative sources from rumors
	•	Confidence calibration needs improvement, as it can fail to convey uncertainty accurately
	•	Minor formatting errors in reports and citations
	•	Longer execution times for complex queries

These issues will rapidly improve with further usage and refinement.

Access & Availability

Deep Research is currently compute-intensive. The longer it takes to research a query, the more inference compute is required.
	•	Available today for Pro users (100 queries per month)
	•	Rolling out next to Plus and Team users
	•	Enterprise version to follow

We are also working on a faster, more cost-effective version powered by a smaller model that still provides high-quality results.

Regional Availability

Deep Research is currently unavailable in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the European Economic Area, but we anticipate expanding access in the coming months.

What’s Next?

Deep Research is available today on ChatGPT web and will roll out to mobile and desktop apps within the month.

In the future, it will be able to connect to specialized data sources, such as subscription-based or internal company databases, making its output even more robust and personalized.

Looking ahead, we envision agentic experiences in ChatGPT where Deep Research (for online investigation) and Operator (for real-world execution) will work together, enabling ChatGPT to carry out increasingly sophisticated tasks for you.

Updates & Future Expansions

February 5, 2025:
	•	Deep Research now available to Pro users in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and EEA.

February 3, 2025:
	•	Additional safety testing and governance reviews have been conducted on o3, identifying it as Medium risk.
	•	Mitigations added to improve browsing safety.
	•	A system card outlining safety measures will be published when access expands to Plus users.

Deep Research is now live in ChatGPT for Pro users. Try it today.

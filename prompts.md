# Prompts

Some of my favorite go-to prompts for ChatGPT.

## gpt best practices
```
i want you to help me write the most effective, efficient, overall best prompts possible for an app i’m working on called faith forward — we’ll be creating a lot of christian content like devotionals, biblical analysis, sermons, and so on.

consider these best practices:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
write clear instructions
- include details in your query to get more relevant answers
- ask the model to adopt a persona
- use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- specify the steps required to complete a task
- provide examples
- specify the desired length of the output

split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
- use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query
- for dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue
- summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively

give gpts time to "think"
- instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
- use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process
- ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

also keep in mind the distinction between the user prompt and the system prompt: the system prompt defines the persona of the model, its purpose, its style; the user prompt defines the specific task it should apply itself to in that moment/request.

for ease of maintenance and readability, prompts that are broken into bulleted sections (or at least avoid long paragraphs) are preferable (all else equal).
```

## The prompt prompt
```
I need a prompt to initialize an LLM conversation with. This prompt should be detailed, specific, and effective. It should read in the second person, i.e. “you are a …” and “your purpose is …”. The prompt should define a persona, a purpose, and a style. The defined agent should always be the highest possible quality resource, and should always ask clarifying questions when answers to those questions would help them better accomplish their objective.

## Write prompts for Midjourney to generate wallpapers
```
Write a descriptive and imaginative prompt for an AI art generator to create a visually stunning wallpaper. Your prompt should include details about the subject matter, style, atmosphere, and medium you envision. Use the phrase 'wallpaper by' followed by the name of one or two artists whose style matches your prompt as inspiration. Keep your prompt concise, no longer than a short paragraph. Omit quotation marks from your responses, and append each response with " --ar 16:9". Remember, the more specific and unique your prompt, the better the resulting wallpaper will be.

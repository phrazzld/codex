Some of my favorite go-to prompts for ChatGPT.

## Write prompts for Midjourney to generate wallpapers
```
Write a descriptive and imaginative prompt for an AI art generator to create a visually stunning wallpaper. Your prompt should include details about the subject matter, style, atmosphere, and medium you envision. Use the phrase 'wallpaper by' followed by the name of one or two artists whose style matches your prompt as inspiration. Keep your prompt concise, no longer than a short paragraph. Omit quotation marks from your responses, and append each response with " --ar 3:2". Remember, the more specific and unique your prompt, the better the resulting wallpaper will be.
